      <h1 id="origins">Why do we use Agile?</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">Agile was an attempt to address the high rate of software project failures.</p>

    <h3>The old way of developing software</h3>
    <p>When a company needed a new computer system they would hire people who specialised in designing and building them.</p>
    <p>The process of developing a new computer system was often lengthy and expensive and they often suffered from delays, budget overruns and failure in the form of either cancellations or because the finished system didn't deliver what was expected.</p>
    <p>In hindsight, the cause of many of the failures was seen to be the process itself.</p>
    <p>Each step produced outputs that became the inputs to the next step. The lengthy process of <strong>System Analysis and Design</strong> produced a specification for a team of programmers to implement. It was important to make sure that the program matched the specification. At each stage, contracts and documentation became the tools to protect from blame. Everyhing made as comprehensive as possible to cover every eventuality which had the side effect of making everything more complex, costly and likely to fail.</p>

    <p>Can you spot the problem? Water flows down-hill - there is no easy way for later stages to feed back into previous ones especially when the people concerned with each stage had often moved on to the next project.</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>What if a requirement was missed and identified during testing?</li>
    	<li>What if a deployment issue required changes to the design?</li>
    	<li>What if testing highlighted a misunderstanding with requirements?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If a system failed was it because the requirements were wrong? Or the design was faulty? Or maybe it was coded badly? Or not tested well enough? Or operations screwed up? So many fingers to point between differenty teams that reliance on contracts and documentation was inevitable but equally unhelpful.</p>
    <p>The other issue was that the process took so long that even if everything was done perfectly, what was inevitably delivered was the system that the company needed 2 years ago when the requirements were first identified. Times change and businesses need to react quickly and the waterfal approach simply didn't allow companies to operate in an agile manner.</p>
	 <p>These <a href="http://www.businessballs.com/treeswing.htm">issues were so well known for so long</a> that people even created <a href="http://www.projectcartoon.com/">online cartoon generators</a> to satirise the far too common experiences with the project management process:</p>

    <p>Software development had to do better as an industry ...</p>

  <!-- The Agile Manifesto
  ================================================== -->
  <div class="bs-docs-section">
    <div class="page-header">
      <h1 id="agile-manifesto">The Agile Manifesto</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">The Agile Manifestor is based on a set of core principals.</p>

	<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
   <h4>Agile Manifesto</h4>
	<p>We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>
		<li>Working software over comprehensive documentation</li>
		<li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
		<li>Responding to change over following a plan</li>
	</ul>
	<p>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.</p>
   </div>    

   <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
   <h4>Core Principals</h4>
   <p>We follow these principles:</p>
   <ul>
<li>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.</li>

<li>Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.</li>

<li>Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.</li>

<li>Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.</li>

<li>Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.</li>

<li>The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.lip>

<li>Working software is the primary measure of progress.</li>

<li>Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</li>

<li>Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.</li>

<li>Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.</li>

<li>The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.</li>

<li>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.</li>
		</ul>
